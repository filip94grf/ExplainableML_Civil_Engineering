Implementation of the Explainable Machine Learning algorithms in two case studies (Prediction of the fundamental period of bare/infill RC frames and Prediction of the Axial Capacity of Steel Tubular CFST Columns) in Civil Engineering:

Symbolic regression, 
Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), 
Model trees, 
Generalized additive models with spline terms (GAM), and 
LASSO-regularized polynomial regression
